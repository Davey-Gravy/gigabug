Gigabug is the operating tradename and website of Matt Bowring. It's a creative project to have fun with software in a new fun way. Get your friends and make something cool.

I'm exploring analog probabilistic logic for computing applications. It will be the primary focus of my graduate study. See more.

I'm also an engineer, (soon) graduate student, and do'er of things. See [resume](/about/matt-bowring-resume.pdf) for career experience. I have many other hobbies and try to write about them here.
