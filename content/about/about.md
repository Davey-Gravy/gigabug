Welcome to the personal website of Matt Bowring.

I'm an engineer, graduate student, and do'er of things. Currently building an [Ising machine](https://gigabug.org/posts/ising/) to study analog probabilistic logic. See my [resume](/about/matt-bowring-resume.pdf) for work experience.

Stay tuned for more.
