Gigabug is the operating tradename and website of Matt Bowring. It's a creative project to have fun with software and share with friends.

I'm an engineer, graduate student, do'er of things, and currently developing an [Ising machine](https://gigabug.org/posts/ising/) to study analog probabilistic logic. See my [resume](/about/matt-bowring-resume.pdf) for work experience.

Stay tuned for more.
