Gigabug is the website of Matt Bowring. I built it as an expressive outlet to write, learn web development, and share with the world. I work as a software engineer, and spend time reading and staying active. My interests are guided by physics, engineering, economics, and psychology. Work experience is available on my [resume](/about/matt-bowring-resume.pdf).

This site will undergo changes. I've done sketching to organize content, but I'm sticking with the default theme template for now.
