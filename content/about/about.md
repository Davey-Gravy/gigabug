## What we do

Gigabug Computer develops novel printed circuit boards to make physics-based computing more accessible. We aim to have the first commercially available circuit to accelerate adoption of this emerging compute paradigm.

Modern advances in artificial intelligence drive the need for specialized hardware to accelerate hard optimization problems. Recently, the search to scale compute “beyond Moore” has focused research on coupled oscillator systems. The key feature of oscillator-based hardware is the energy efficiency in representing computation as a natural physical process. These so-called Ising machines are physical devices that minimize the energy potential 

$$H = - \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{J} \mathbf{s}$$ 

by the evolution of the system variables $\mathbf{s}$ to equilibrium through an annealing process. The physical variables are made analogous to the logical variables of the input problem. Such devices have been implemented with lasers, fiber optics, electronics, nano-magnets, qubits, and fully digital programs. 

Can be understand as sampling for machine learning.

However, there remains fundamental software and hardware challenges to scale these systems towards commercial use.
